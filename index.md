## Uber Trips Analysis report 

This report summarises Uber trips of a Uber driver from 2016. We will be using this data to learn from the behaviour of an ordinary Uber customer. 

Data Set is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/uberdrives?resource=download)

Here, with this data, we are trying to answer the following question : 
  > *How can we offer more benefits to our customers to increase/encourage the use of Uber? *

In order to prepare, process, analyse and visualise the data, data was imported and cleaned using 
> pandas 
> numpy
> datetime
> matplotlib
> seaborn

To better analyse the data, it was transformed as follows:
> Get the month , days of the week, day, hour on the date of the trip - 'Start Date, End Date' 
> Compute the 'Travel Time' basis 'End Date' - 'Starting Date'
> Calculate 'Average speed of a trip'

Visualizing the data
